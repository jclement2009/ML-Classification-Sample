# ML-Classification-Sample
A project that utilizes several classification algorithms in maximizing prediction rates:
* K Nearest Neighbors
* Linear Discriminant Analysis
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Decision Tree
* Naive Bayes  

The data for this project is taken from the wolfram repository at https://datarepository.wolframcloud.com/resources/Sample-Data-Swiss-Bank-Notes.
